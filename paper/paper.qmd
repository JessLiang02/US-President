# Introduction

In recent years, polling has become a critical tool for measuring public opinion and predicting political outcomes, particularly in U.S. presidential elections. As public reliance on polling data has grown, so has the need for scrutiny around its reliability and accuracy. Factors such as timing, geographic variation, pollster methodology, and poll quality can significantly affect reported levels of candidate support. For example, the timing of a poll relative to key campaign events or the methods used by different pollsters can cause variations in the support reported for candidates. These inconsistencies raise important questions about how polling differences, particularly across states and polling organizations, impact public opinion forecasts. In the context of the 2024 U.S. election, a clear understanding of these dynamics is crucial for accurate poll interpretation, particularly regarding Donald Trump’s percentage support.

This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature by systematically analyzing how polling variables such as end date, state, pollster, and poll score influence Trump's support. The estimand in this analysis is the percentage support for Donald Trump as reported in polls. While previous studies have examined isolated factors like poll timing or specific pollsters, few have investigated how these variables interact. Using a linear regression model, we assess the contributions of each variable, exploring how factors such as time, geographic region, and poll quality influence polling results. Additionally, we account for potential non-linearities and omitted variables, such as demographic and economic factors, that may further explain variations in Trump’s support.

Our findings identify several key influences on polling outcomes. State-level differences in support are significant, with some states consistently showing higher or lower levels of support for Trump. Poll score also plays a critical role, with higher-quality polls typically reporting lower support, indicating that less rigorous polls may overestimate Trump’s backing. Additionally, the analysis reveals pollster-specific biases, where certain organizations systematically report higher or lower support, necessitating careful consideration of pollster effects. Diagnostic tests show potential violations of key model assumptions, such as heteroscedasticity and non-normality, suggesting that more sophisticated models may be needed to better capture these relationships. These results are crucial for improving the accuracy of election forecasts and ensuring more reliable interpretations of polling data.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows. @sec-data introduces the data sources and the key variables utilized in our analysis, offering a comprehensive overview of the dataset and how the variables were selected. @sec-model outlines the modeling strategy, including the linear regression framework, along with its underlying assumptions and the rationale for the inclusion of specific predictors like state, pollster, and poll score. @sec-results presents the model results, emphasizing the significant factors driving Trump’s percentage support and analyzing any diagnostic issues such as heteroscedasticity and residual normality. @sec-discussion delves into the broader implications of our findings, discussing their relevance to polling accuracy, potential biases, and offering suggestions for future research to enhance predictive modeling in political contexts.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

For this analysis, we employed the R programming language [@citeR] to examine polling data on public sentiment before the election. Our dataset, sourced from FiveThirtyEight [@fivethirtyeight2024], offers a detailed snapshot of evolving public opinion. We explored key influences on percentage support, including the timing of the polls, pollster characteristics, and geographic differences.

Several `R` packages were instrumental in performing data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. `tidyverse` was the backbone for organizing and analyzing the data efficiently, allowing seamless integration of multiple tasks [@thereferencecanbewhatever]. `here` streamlined file path handling, ensuring smooth data access across systems [@citehere]. We relied on `janitor` for robust data cleaning, helping identify and fix potential inconsistencies [@citejanitor], and `lubridate` facilitated the manipulation of time-related variables [@citelubridate]. Additionally, `arrow` provided fast and memory-efficient access to large datasets, a critical factor for managing extensive polling data [@citearrow]. Finally, `testthat` facilitates efficient unit testing on the simulated and the analysis datasets. The structure of the codebase and workflow adhered to the best practices outlined in @tellingstories.

## Measurement
	
Accurately measuring Donald Trump’s support is crucial for our analysis, as it converts the complex and often conflicting opinions of individuals into reliable numerical data. We begin by standardizing survey design and question phrasing across different polling organizations to minimize measurement bias. By ensuring that questions are consistently formulated—such as using uniform language like "Do you support Donald Trump for President?"—we reduce variability introduced by differing methodologies. Representative sampling techniques, including random digit dialing and stratified sampling, are employed to capture a diverse and accurate snapshot of voter sentiment. These methods ensure that our sample mirrors the demographic and geographic composition of the electorate, thereby enhancing the validity of our support measurements.

The primary outcome variable, Trump’s percentage support, is derived through meticulous data aggregation and weighting processes. Poll results from sources like FiveThirtyEight [@fivethirtyeight2024] are combined into a comprehensive dataset, where each poll is weighted based on factors such as sample size, sampling method, and poll quality. This weighting standardizes the data, mitigating the impact of outlier polls or those with limited geographic coverage. Additionally, we conduct validation and reliability checks by comparing our measurements against historical data and actual election outcomes to identify and correct potential sources of error, such as non-response bias or misreporting. This rigorous approach ensures that our percentage support figures accurately reflect public opinion over time and across different states.

Equally important are the precise measurements of our predictor variables: poll end date, state, pollster, and poll quality. Poll end date is recorded as the date when data collection concluded, allowing us to track temporal trends in support. The state variable identifies the geographical location of each poll, enabling regional analysis of support levels. Pollster denotes the organization conducting the poll, accounting for methodological differences that may influence results. Poll quality, assessed through a comprehensive poll score, reflects the reliability and methodological rigor of each poll based on sample size, sampling techniques, and question phrasing. By ensuring the integrity of both outcome and predictor variables through standardization, calibration, and transparency, we establish a robust foundation for analyzing the factors that shape voter sentiment, ultimately providing meaningful insights into the electoral landscape leading up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

## Outcome variable

### The percentage support for Trump in the poll

The percentage support for Trump in polls represents the portion of respondents who favor Donald Trump in a given survey. This measure is crucial in gauging his popularity, especially in the context of upcoming elections. Expressed as a percentage, it ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating greater support. The percentage of support can vary across different polls depending on factors such as sample size, region, and methodology. A strong polling result with higher percentages suggests robust backing, while lower percentages indicate weaker favorability among the surveyed population.

@fig-pct shows Trump's percentage support across polls, mostly clustered between 40% and 50%. There's a peak around 45%, with a slight right skew indicating a few polls showing higher support, up to 55%. Very few polls show support below 30% or above 50%, suggesting moderate and stable backing with minimal outliers. This distribution reflects consistent mid-range support for Trump across the sampled polls.

```

## Predictor variables

### End date

The end date marks the final day of data collection for a poll, signaling the close of the survey period. It provides critical context by showing when the poll reflects public opinion, as sentiments can evolve rapidly due to factors like news cycles, political events, or campaign strategies. The earliest end date is `r min(analysis_data$end_date)` and the latest end date is `r max(analysis_data$end_date)`.

### State

The state variable indicates where the poll was conducted, either in a specific U.S. state (e.g., Arizona or California) or across the nation ("National"). State polls focus on regional voter preferences, while national polls provide an overall view of public sentiment across the country. This distinction helps in analyzing both local and nationwide trends.

@fig-state shows the number of polls conducted, with national polls leading by a wide margin, surpassing 250. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona have the highest number of state-specific polls, each below 60. Other key states like Michigan, Georgia, and Texas follow, while states like Missouri and Colorado have the fewest. The focus on national and battleground states highlights their electoral importance.

```

### Poll score

The poll score is a rating that measures the reliability and quality of a poll based on various criteria, including the pollster’s history, the clarity of their methodology, and the sample's representativeness. Higher scores indicate greater credibility, suggesting the poll follows rigorous methods and provides an accurate reflection of public opinion. In contrast, lower scores may reveal flaws such as bias, insufficient sample sizes, or poor transparency, making the results less dependable for drawing conclusions.

@fig-pollscore displays the distribution of poll scores, with two distinct peaks. Most polls cluster around scores of -1.5 and -1.1, indicating that the majority of polls have similar ratings. There is a small number of polls with scores around -1.3, suggesting less frequent variation in the middle of the range.

```

### Pollster

The pollster are known as the organization responsible for conducting the poll, such as Emerson, YouGov, or Quinnipiac. These organizations collect data to gauge public opinion on various topics, including political preferences. Each pollster employs its own methodologies, sampling, and geographic coverage, which can lead to variations in results and influence the overall reliability of the poll.

@fig-pollster illustrates the number of polls conducted by various polling organizations. YouGov leads with over 200 polls, followed closely by Siena/NYT, which has just under 200. Other pollsters, such as Marquette Law School, have significantly fewer polls, and the remaining organizations conducted only a handful of surveys.

# Model {#sec-model}

Our aim is to quantify the relationship between key variables, such as the end date of the poll, the state, the poll score, and the pollster, and the percentage support for Trump. We employ a linear regression model to investigate how each of these factors influences support levels. Our linear regression model includes the end date, pollster, state, and poll score as predictors, allowing us to quantify their individual impact. By estimating the coefficients, we can assess the direction and strength of their effects, providing insights into which variables play the most significant role in shaping public opinion.  More comprehensive details on the model's specification, underlying assumptions, and diagnostic checks are provided in [Appendix @sec-model-spec] and [Appendix -@sec-model-diag]. For a full description of the validation procedures used, please refer to [Appendix -@sec-model-valid].

The modeling choices align with the structure of the data. We treat the end date as a continuous variable to capture any linear trends over time. Pollster and state are treated as categorical variables to reflect inherent group differences without assuming any specific order. Poll score remains continuous to preserve its detail and capture the nuanced impact of poll quality on support levels. These decisions ensure that essential characteristics of the data are preserved, allowing for a more accurate and informative analysis.

## Model set-up

### Model 1: Percentage support as a function of end date

The first model investigates how the end date of a poll impacts the percentage of support for Trump. Mathematically, it is represented as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i & =\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1 i}+\epsilon_i \\
\epsilon_i & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:

- $y_i$ denotes the percentage support for Trump in poll $i$
- $x_{1 i}$ is the end date of poll $i$
- $\beta_0$ represents the intercept, which is the baseline level of support
- $\beta_1$ captures the effect of the end date on percentage support
- $\epsilon_i$ is the error term, assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variance $\sigma^2$

### Model 2: Percentage support as a function of end date, state, poll score, and pollster

In the second model, we extend the analysis by including additional variables: the state in which the poll was conducted, the poll score, and the pollster. The equation is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1  x_{1 i}+\beta_2  x_{2 i}+\beta_3  x_{3 i}+\beta_4  x_{4 i}+\epsilon_i \\
& \epsilon_i \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


Where:

- $y_i$ represents the percentage support for Trump in poll $i$,
- $x_{1 i}$ is the end date of the poll
- $x_{2 i}$ corresponds to the state where the poll was conducted
- $x_{3 i}$ is the poll score, indicating the quality of the poll
- $x_{4 i}$ represents the pollster who conducted the poll
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4$ are the coefficients corresponding to each predictor variable, measuring their individual effects
- $\epsilon_i$ is the error term, which follows a norma ${ }^1$ - istribution with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$

We run the models in R [@citeR].

### Modeling justification

The first model examines how the end date of a poll influences Trump’s percentage support, based on the idea that public opinion shifts over time due to external events or campaign developments. By treating the end date as a continuous variable, the model captures trends in support, where polls conducted closer to the election are expected to reflect more accurate voter preferences. The linear regression approach provides a simple way to quantify this relationship.

The second model expands by incorporating state, poll score, and pollster as additional predictors. These variables are key factors influencing polling outcomes, as state-level differences, poll quality, and methodologies of various pollsters can all affect the results. Including these predictors allows the model to control for geographic and methodological variations, offering a clearer picture of the factors driving Trump’s support. The use of linear regression ensures that the model remains interpretable while accounting for these important influences.

While linear regression models were selected for their simplicity and interpretability, several alternative approaches were considered to potentially capture more complex relationships within the polling data. Hierarchical (Multilevel) Models were evaluated for their ability to account for nested data structures, such as polls within states or pollsters. However, the added complexity was deemed unnecessary given the study's focus on general trends and the limited sample sizes within each subgroup. Machine Learning Algorithms, including random forests and gradient boosting machines, were also considered for their capacity to model non-linear relationships and interactions without explicit specification. Despite their superior predictive accuracy, these models were excluded due to their reduced interpretability, which is crucial for understanding the specific factors influencing Trump’s support.

Additionally, Time Series Models like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were explored to handle temporal dependencies in the data. However, the cross-sectional nature of the polling dataset and the incorporation of poll end dates as continuous predictors made these models less suitable. Logistic Regression was considered but ultimately rejected because the outcome variable of interest—Trump’s percentage support—is continuous rather than binary. Lastly, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was evaluated for its ability to analyze complex relationships between variables, but the requirement for substantial data and strong theoretical foundations led to its exclusion in favor of the more straightforward linear regression approach. These decisions ensure that the chosen models effectively balance complexity, interpretability, and the study’s primary objectives of elucidating clear and actionable insights into voter sentiment dynamics.

```

In Model 1, the intercept is estimated at -131.653 , meaning that when the end date is at zero (far back in time), the predicted percentage support for Trump would be negative, though this has no real-world interpretation due to the range of actual dates. The coefficient for end date is positive (0.009), indicating that as time progresses (later end dates), Trump's percentage support slightly increases by 0.009 percentage points per day. This is a statistically significant result given the low standard error (0.001). The model explains $13.2 \%$ of the variation in support ( $R^2=0.132$ ), which is relatively modest, and has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.96, meaning there is some error in the predictions.

Model 2 expands on the predictors, including state, poll score, and pollster. The intercept decreases to -223.206, with the coefficient for end date still positive but slightly smaller (0.008), showing a similar upward trend in support over time. Many state-level coefficients show how different states' support for Trump compares to the baseline category (Colorado). For instance, Florida has a positive and statistically significant coefficient (5.903), suggesting higher support for Trump compared to Colorado, while Nebraska CD-2 has a negative coefficient (-5.475), indicating lower support.

The poll score has a negative coefficient (-92.960), meaning higher poll quality (or score) tends to show lower support for Trump. Among pollsters, Siena/NYT has a notably negative coefficient (-35.982), indicating that this pollster tends to report significantly lower Trump support compared to the baseline.

Model 2 improves overall fit, explaining $35 \%$ of the variation in support ( $R^2=0.350$ ) and reducing the RMSE to 3.43, indicating better predictive accuracy. The AIC and BIC values also decrease (AIC = 2605.4, BIC = 2709.8), suggesting that Model 2 is a better fit compared to Model 1.

Overall, the expanded Model 2 captures more variation in support, with state, poll score, and pollster contributing significantly to the predictive power.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Influence of State-Level Variability on Support 

Model 2 reveals significant variability in Trump’s percentage support across different states. For instance, states like Florida and Missouri show a positive and statistically significant increase in support compared to the baseline (Colorado), while Nebraska CD-2 and Virginia exhibit lower support. This demonstrates the importance of geographic factors in understanding voter preferences, as state-specific dynamics heavily influence the overall level of support. Campaign strategies might need to be tailored for individual states, especially swing states or regions showing significant divergence in support.

## Impact of Poll Score on Reported Support

The poll score coefficient in Model 2 is negative, suggesting that polls with higher methodological rigor or better quality report lower support for Trump. This is an important finding, as it indicates that lower-quality polls might overstate Trump’s support, potentially leading to biased or skewed interpretations of his popularity. This result emphasizes the need to critically evaluate poll quality when analyzing and aggregating polling data to avoid misleading conclusions.

## Improvement in Model Performance with Additional Predictors 

The improvement in model fit ($R^2$ increasing from 0.132 in Model 1 to 0.350 in Model 2) and the reduction in RMSE (from 3.96 to 3.43) highlights the importance of including multiple factors in the analysis. Adding state, poll score, and pollster as predictors significantly enhances the model's ability to explain the variability in Trump’s percentage support. This suggests that relying solely on temporal trends (as in Model 1) may miss key contextual factors, such as the influence of geographic and methodological differences, in explaining public opinion.

## Overall Influence of Factors on Percentage Support

The inclusion of multiple factors in Model 2—such as state, poll score, and pollster—demonstrates that Trump’s percentage support is influenced by a combination of geographic, methodological, and temporal factors. The model highlights that no single variable fully explains the variation in support, but rather, a combination of these factors work together to shape public opinion. The coefficients for state-level variables suggest that regional differences play a significant role, while the poll score and pollster coefficients indicate that the methodology and quality of the polls themselves also have a measurable impact. This underscores the importance of considering multiple dimensions when analyzing polling data, as relying solely on one factor (such as time) may overlook key influences such as regional trends or poll quality. 

## Weaknesses and next steps

Model 2, while an improvement over Model 1, may still suffer from omitted variable bias as key demographic factors like age, education, and economic conditions are not included. These variables likely influence Trump's support across different states and their absence could limit the model's ability to fully explain variation. Additionally, the residual plot and the Normal Q-Q plot suggest potential heteroscedasticity and deviations from normality (@fig-diag-1; @fig-diag-2), indicating the model struggles with capturing non-linear dynamics or outliers, particularly during significant shifts in public opinion or extreme polling outcomes. The limited pollster-specific effects also fail to account for interactions between pollsters and factors like state or poll quality, which could lead to oversimplified interpretations of polling data.

To address these issues, future models should consider including demographic and economic variables to improve accuracy and capture a more comprehensive picture of Trump's support. Additionally, exploring non-linear relationships using polynomial terms or splines could help better capture the complexity of public opinion changes over time. It would also be valuable to investigate interaction effects between pollster, state, and poll score to understand how these factors jointly influence results. Finally, addressing the heteroscedasticity and potential non-normality identified in the residual plots, through transformations or the use of robust standard errors, will improve the model's reliability and interpretation.

\appendix

# Appendix {-}

## Model specification {#sec-model-spec}

The model specification assumes a linear relationship between predictors (such as end date, state, poll score, and pollster) and Trump’s percentage support. It also assumes homoscedasticity, meaning the variance of errors is constant across all fitted values, and that errors are independently and normally distributed. The model also treats pollster and state as categorical variables, assuming no interaction effects between them and other factors. These assumptions provide a straightforward, interpretable model.

## Model diagnostics {#sec-model-diag}

@fig-diag-1 shows the relationship between the fitted values (predicted Trump support) and the residuals (errors). Ideally, the residuals should be randomly distributed around zero without any clear pattern or clusters, which would indicate a linear good model fit and that the independent errors assumption is satisfied. However, this plot shows some visible structure and a potential funnel shape, suggesting possible heteroscedasticity, meaning that the variance of the residuals changes with the fitted values. This may indicate that the model’s assumptions of constant variance are violated, warranting further investigation into model improvements or the need for transformation of variables.

@fig-diag-2 compares the residuals to a theoretical normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should closely follow the red line. In this case, most of the points lie along the line, suggesting that the residuals are approximately normal. However, there is some deviation at the tails, particularly at the lower end, where the residuals fall below the line. This indicates potential non-normality in the distribution of residuals, particularly in the extremes, which may suggest that the model struggles to fit extreme values as accurately.

## Model validation {#sec-model-valid}

Model validation via Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is an important aspect of assessing the accuracy and predictive power of regression models. RMSE provides a measure of how well the model's predicted values align with the actual observed values, specifically focusing on the magnitude of prediction errors.

The RMSE tells us how far off the model's predictions are from the actual values, in the same units as the dependent variable (percentage support). In this context, an RMSE of 3.43 means that, on average, Model 2's predictions deviate from the true percentage support by approximately 3.43 percentage points. This is an improvement over Model 1, where the average deviation is about 3.96 percentage points. While both RMSE values are relatively low, the reduction in RMSE from Model 1 to Model 2 suggests that including additional predictors (such as state and poll score) meaningfully enhances the model's precision. This improvement is particularly important for making more informed predictions, as Model 2 captures more variability in the data.
